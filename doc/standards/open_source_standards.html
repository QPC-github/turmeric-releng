  <h1>Open Source Project Architecture Standards</h1>

  <p>
    An attempt at documenting some of the standards found in use around the
    various Open Source communities ...
  </p>

  <p>
    The organization of this document is to try to establish a list
    of the standards, some recommendations, importance, and at the
    end a Plan of how to achieve these goals in the long run.
  </p>

  <h2>Definitions</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt>Project</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>
        This primarily refers to the project as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our case, the project is "Turmeric"
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Module</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>
        This is a specific conceptual piece of the project.
      </p>

      <p>
        In maven terms, this would be equivalent to a directory with
        a pom.xml
      </p>

      <p>
        Some people refer to this directory as a "project" as well,
        and while that is legitimate and valid, for the purposes of
        this document, we will refrain from using "project" to refer
        to this concept.
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>SCM</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>
        Source Control Management.<br>
        Can refer to Subversion (SVN) or Git.<br>
        If we are talking about a specific implementation detail for
        a specific SCM, then the SCM specific name will be used
      </p>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>Maven</h2>

  <p>
    Maven is the most common build tool for Open Source Java.
  </p>

  <p>
    The most important tenet of maven is:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    "Convention over Configuration"
  </blockquote>

  <ol>
    <li>Maven Structural POMs<br>
    The main purpose of structural poms is to gain abilities to
    perform project wide work via the build reactor.<br>
    This is crucial for the release plugin.<br>
    Also, many of the other plugins, have special modes when
    operating in aggregate or reactor modes. (such as&nbsp;</li>

    <li>Maven Parent POMs<br>
    The use of a parent pom is encouraged for all of the modules
    within the project.<br>
    We definitely need 1 level deep, but 2 levels could serve the
    greater needs of the core and toolchain better. (see "Project
    Organization" section below)</li>

    <li>Top level Project Standards

      <ol>
        <li>Plugin Configurations

          <ol>
            <li>Maven Compiler Plugin<br>
            Standardize on a JDK/JRE version.<br>
            Propose we stick with Java 1.6</li>

            <li>Jar Plugin<br>
            Do we have any manifest standards to adhere
            to?<br></li>

            <li>PMD Plugin</li>

            <li>Findbugs Plugin</li>

            <li>Cobertura Plugin (Test Coverage)</li>

            <li>Enforcer Plugin<br>
            Setup rules as needed.<br>
            First potential rule is minimum maven version.
            (Proposed: maven 2.2.1)</li>

            <li>Toolchain Plugins<br>
            Custom plugins (such as maven-soa-plugin) should go
            here</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>Dependencies

          <ol>
            <li>Junit Version<br>
            Propose we stick with 4.4 for now (upgrade to 4.8.1 in
            future)</li>

            <li>3rd Party Versions<br>
            This is where you would identify the artifacts for your
            3rd party items, and the versions that the project as a
            whole will use.</li>

            <li>Shared Project Versions

              <ol>
                <li>The parent pom should declare an overall
                version for the project, that all modules
                share.</li>

                <li>The development time version should end in
                -SNAPSHOT<br>
                Suggestion 1.0.0.turmeric-SNAPSHOT is a good
                starting point. (This would also help eBay identify
                what artifacts are part of the turmeric effort)<br>
                We should implement this common version now, and
                work to establish this version across the board for
                all of the modules and parent pom.<br>
                We can change this version to something more in
                line with reality at any point after we have
                established the appropriate plumbing in the parent
                poms.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Module Layout Standards<br>

            The plugin itself can attach this directory to the
            build at the appropriate build scope.<br>
            m2eclipse plugin is capable of identifying these plugin

    <li>Release Requirements (for Central repository)

      <ol>
        <li>All modules in the project should strive to be version
        locked (meaning, they all have the same version)<br>
          Note: the /toolchain/ and /turmeric-project/ trees are
          the exceptions to this rule (these 2 trees will be moved
          out of the /SOAProject/trunk/ in the future.

          <ol>
            <li>When working on the code between releases, the
            version should include -SNAPSHOT to indicate that it is
            not yet blessed (possibly unstable)</li>

            <li>When releasing, using the maven-release-plugin...

              <ol>
                <li>all snapshot versions will be automatically
                incremented to the release version.</li>

                <li>the release is built</li>

                <li>the release is tagged in scm</li>

                <li>the versions are incremented again to the next
                development version.</li>

                <li>the SCM tree (trunk) is commited with this next
                development version.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>No plugins versions can be SNAPSHOT versioned for a
        release. (this is a rule of the maven-release-plugin)</li>

        <li>In order to have artifacts that make it into the
        central repository the builds <u>must have</u> the
        following in place.</li>
      </ol>

      <p style="margin-left: 2em">
        <ol>
          <li>Licensing files for each module.</li>

          <li>This means a file with the declared license, such as
          LICENSE.txt</li>

          <li>Licensing present in packaged artifact.</li>

          <li>Module poms contain License declaration</li>

          <li>Module poms contain url for project</li>

          <li>Module poms contain at least 1 declared
          developer</li>

          <li>Module poms contain <u>no</u> repository
          definitions</li>

          <li>Module poms contain dependencies accessible via
          central repository</li>

          <li>This means we can't depend on internal dependencies
          that are themselves unreleased.</li>

          <li>Concerned with uKernel on this specific rule.</li>

          <li>Javadoc classifier package (only for jar or war
          artifacts with class files)</li>

          <li>This means our release profile (maven concept) has
          the maven-javadoc-plugin:jar goal declared</li>

          <li>Source classifier package (for jar and war
          artifacts)</li>

          <li>This means our release profile (maven concept) has
          the maven-source-plugin:jar goal declared</li>

          <li>License text present in *.java and *.xml source files
          present in source classifier</li>

          <li>All artifacts, and poms are signed via gpg</li>

          <li>This means our release profile (maven concept) has
          the maven-gpg-plugin declared, and the release engineers
          have a properly setup $HOME/.m2/settings.xml for their
          gpg credentials.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>Shared Content<br>
    If your build should need to share content between modules,
    then an module / artifact / classifier should be created to
    share that content with the other modules via the repository
    system.<br>
    Note: this artifact can be setup to not deploy during a release
    if need be.</li>

    <li>Build Levels<br>
      The build can be as simple or as complex as the developer and
      user wants it to be.<br>
      Nothing is assumed to be minimum or required.<br>
      It is appropriate to disable plugins and whatnot in module
      poms if inappropriate. (such as setting the surefire plugin
      to skip running if the project has no unit tests)<br>

      <ol>
        <li>Basic Artifact Build</li>

        <li>Unit Testing</li>

        <li>Packaging</li>

        <li>Installation</li>

        <li>Maven Repository Deployment</li>

        <li>Integration Testing</li>

        <li>Functional Testing</li>

        <li>Report Generation (Individual and Aggregate)

          <ol>
            <li>JXR</li>

            <li>Javadoc</li>

            <li>Analysis Tools</li>

            <li>Maven Project Information Reports</li>

            <li>WSDL Documentation</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol><br>

  <h2>Continuous Integration</h2>The practice of Continuous
  Integration of the build is a highly desired one and encourages a
  stable source control and ensures that all appropriate testing is
  performed.

  <p>
    Recommend: use of Hudson CI -&nbsp;<a href=
    "http://hudson-ci.org/">http://hudson-ci.org/</a><br>
    <br>

    <p>
      This should be done in stages.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Stage 1

        <ol>
          <li>Monitory the SVN repository and perform a build on
          detected change.</li>

          <li>Basic Build &amp; Unit Testing</li>

          <li>Report on build or testing failures</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>Stage 2

        <ol>
          <li>Runs at least once a day (nightly is a good time to
          run this stage, as the analysis can be quite costly,
          resources and time wise)</li>

          <li>Can be enabled via a maven profile, or by just
          declaring the plugins you wish to execute on the build
          configuration</li>

          <li>Add various analysis tooling (PMD, Findbugs,
          etc...)</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>Stage 3

        <ol>
          <li>If tests take a while to run, then run this
          integration testing at least twice a week<br></li>

          <li>If tests are quick, then run them at the same time as
          Stage 1 (this is the desired mode, but often as projects
          grown in size, this level of testing is broken out)</li>

          <li>Integration Testing is performed.<br></li>

          <li>The maven-it-plugin is often used as a kick-off for
          this level of testing.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>Stage 4

        <ol>
          <li>Primarily a manually initiated build &amp; testing
          level.<br>
          It can be automated, but the events that trigger this
          automation are very project specific. &nbsp;<br>
          (It would be inappropriate to speculate on a good even at
          this point in time.)</li>

          <li>This is reserved for exhaustive automated testing,
          across environments, browsers, etc..</li>

          <li>This is sometimes called Functional testing.</li>

          <li>Selenium is a typical tools seen at this level.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Subversion</h2>

    <p>
      Subversion as a SCM

      <li>Subversion Properties<br>
        <a href=

        <ol>
          <li><b>svn:ignore</b><br>
          <a href=

          SVN Redbook: svn:ignore property</a><br>

          Applies: Directory only.<br>
          Purpose: To specify files in that directory to ignore
          from update/commit flows in subversion.<br>
          Importance: HIGH<br>
          Suggestion: Ignore temporary files, Ignore maven target
          (build) directory.<br>
          Advanced: Ignore IDE project files. (They are best
          managed by m2eclipse anyway)</li>

          <li><b>svn:eol-style</b><br>
          <a href=

          SVN Redbook: svn:eol-style property</a><br>

          Applies: Files only (Text files ideally)<br>
          Purpose: to specify the End of Line format for the text
          files. Values are (native, lf, crlf)<br>
          Importance: HIGH<br>
          Suggestion: for *.java files, we should set this to
          native. &nbsp;This will allow for more consistent
          merging, as it will use the users own native eol
          standards (Windows = CRLF, Unix or OSX = LF)<br>
          From the point in time after this property is set, all
          commits / diffs / merges and the like will be performed
          on an EOL neutral standing. &nbsp;No environment specific
          EOL settings will matter.<br>
          Note: The first time this is set, you will experience a
          merge. &nbsp;It is recommended that when this property is
          set, all developers commit what they have, wait for
          property to be set, then update (just to avoid the
          merge)<br>
          Since we, the developer community here, are on a variety
          of environments, having this set is highly
          encouraged.</li>

          <li><b>svn:mime-type</b><br>
          <a href=
          "http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch07s02.html#svn-ch-7-sect-2.3.2">
          SVN Redbook: svn:mime-type property</a><br>

          Applies: Files only (most files, text and binary)<br>
          Purpose: to specify the mime-type of the file, to avoid
          ambiguity, and to allow various SVN tooling to know how
          to handle the files for merging, editing, and diff
          purposes.<br>
          Importance: MEDIUM to LOW<br>
          Suggestion: set for Image files, and other Web Accessible
          Content (html, css, xml, wsdl, xsd, etc...)</li>

          <li><b>svn:executable</b><br>
          <a href=
          "http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch07s02.html#svn-ch-7-sect-2.3.1">
          SVN Redbook: svn:executable property</a><br>

          Applies: Files only (files that are meant to be
          executable)<br>
          Purpose: to specify to the SVN that the tagged file is
          executable.<br>
          Importance: LOW<br>
          Suggestion: Set for *.sh, *.bat, and *.cmd files</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>IDE Project Files<br>
        While it is common to include the IDE project files in
        Subversion, in the long run, this should be
        discouraged.<br>
        The m2eclipse plugin is capable of importing raw maven 2
        projects (without an existing .classpath and .project
        files) anyway.<br>
        The primary reasons for not including the IDE project files
        are:

        <ol>
          <li>The .classpath and .project files (and .settings/*)
          often contain user specific details that are incompatible
          with other users</li>

          <li>The contents of the .classpath and .project files
          (and .settings/*) often contain details about the users
          machine, userids, passwords (possibly encrypted) that
          could present a security concern.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <h2>Project Organization (Directories)</h2>

  <p>
    Special Directories
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li><b>/toolchain/</b><br>
    Importance: LOW (only when maven-soa-plugin is due to be
    checked in)<br>
    The toolchain are any projects that don't change very often,
    and are used as part of the day to day build. &nbsp;<br>
    The modules within this tree are versioned separately and
    released separately.<br>
    Ideally, this directory should live outside of the main
    subversion trunk in it's own tree, but that is something we can
    do at the very end of the entire process. &nbsp;Even after we
    "go live" with our official open source repository at the end
    of the project.</li>

    <li><b>/toolchain/maven-soa-plugin/<br></b>Importance: MEDIUM
    (but only when maven-soa-plugin source is due to be checked
    in)<br>
    Place for the maven-soa-plugin open source effort.<br></li>

    <li><b>/toolchain/turmeric-enforcer-rules/<br></b>Importance:
    LOW (only when needed)<br>
    All larger projects tend to have custom enforcer rules.
    &nbsp;They are varied in purpose, but are often valuable sanity
    checks, even if they are only run during the formal release
    process.<br>
    This module houses all of our custom maven-enforcer-plugin
    rules.</li>

    <li><b>/turmeric-project/</b><br>
    Importance: LOW (only needed when /toolchain/ starts to
    exist)<br>
    The purpose of this directory is to house the top level parent
    pom that is shared amongst all project modules within the tree.
    &nbsp;This includes custom work in /toolchain/ and the eclipse
    plugins in /plugins/, as well as the more fundamental modules
    present in the subversion tree.<br></li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Testing</h2>

  <p>
    Levels of testing:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li><b>Unit Tests:</b><br>
    These are the tests found in src/test/java and are executed
    with every build of the module.<br>
    They should focus on testing single classes, or with only
    classes found within the one module.<br>
    If you find yourself writing tests that cross module
    boundaries, then it is likely you are working with an
    integration test.</li>

    <li><b>Integration Tests:</b><br>
    Integration of multiple modules and configurations to test how
    the they interoperate.<br>
    Typically find standards testing in this level, such as TCKs
    and the like.<br>
    Example of Maven itself using Integration Testing
    -&gt;&nbsp;<a href=
    "http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/maven/core-integration-testing/trunk/core-it-suite/src/test/resources/">http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/maven/core-integration-testing/trunk/core-it-suite/src/test/resources/</a></li>

    <li><b>Web / Functional:</b><br>
    With more modern testing, it is often important to test at a
    higher level, and across multiple platforms and
    environments.<br>
    In our case, even multiple browsers.<br>
    This is what Functional testing exists to address.<br>
    Selenium testing is a very common technology found at this
    level.</li>

  Standards</b></font><br>

  </ol>

  <p><br></p>

  <p>It is recommended that one of these two methods be choosen for
  the entire project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>IDE's should be configured to match these guidelines, and
  appropriate IDE specific items checked into the repository, so
  they can be imported easily into the specific IDE.</p>

  <p>Keeping the code formatted similiar helps with:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Accepting patches easier.</li>

    <li>Reading the code easier.</li>

    <li>The less developers have to deal with formatting
    differences the better.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Eclipse Plugin Structure</h2>

  <p>
    TODO:
  </p>

  <h2>Timeline to Implement Plans</h2>

  <p>
    The plan is to phase these changes into the codebase in small
    batches, allow everyone to get comfortable with the changes,
    provide input, etc.<br>
    The goal of the plan is to avoid upheaval of the codebase with
    any sort of massive change or flash cut philosophy.
  </p>

  <p>
    The plans are always subject to change, but that change should
    be based on input, concerns, and open discussion.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is the general order of things on how to attain the goals
    above:
  </p>

  <p>
    The this organization, while linear in presentation, does not
    have to occur one after another, this plenty of room for
    parallelization within this organizational list.
  </p>

  <p>
    Also, not all modules within the project must incur the change
    simultaneously, a selection of modules can undergo this list of
    changes inpidually as far as needed in the plan before moving
    onto the next module.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Implement Maven Structural Poms</li>

    <li>Establish SNAPSHOT Project Version (Suggest:
    1.0.0.turmeric-SNAPSHOT) this will be extra clear in other
    poms, and even be OSGi compatible.<br></li>

    <li>Establish dependency and plugin standards in
    turmeric-parent

      <ol>
        <li>Compiler Plugin to Java 1.6</li>

        <li>Shared/Common modules declared in dependencyManagement

          <ol>
            <li>Junit to 4.4</li>

            <li>SOAClient</li>

            <li>SOAServer</li>

            <li>BindingFwk</li>

      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Start applying turmeric-project parent across the entire
    module tree</li>

    <li>Change module versions to use established project
    version.</li>

    <li>Eliminate from module poms redundant plugin configurations
    more suitable for turmeric-parent pom.</li>

    <li>Establish svn:eol-style on subversion side<br>
    Requires coordination with eBay.<br>
    Should be done in stages, one module at a time.</li>

    <li>Eliminate IDE project files from SCM.<br>
    Can be accomplished in stages, one module at a time.</li>

    <li>Setup SCM ignores on IDE project files.<br>
    Can be performed in parallel with elimination of IDE project
    files from SCM.</li>

    <li>Put maven-soa-plugin source into /toolchain/maven-soa-plugin/</li>

    <li>Adjust maven-soa-plugin to use internal project attachments
    for generated content instead of relying on configuration
    within the module pom.xml pointing to the generated content</li>

    <li>Setup /turmeric-project/ parent pom for core and toolchain
    to share.</li>

    <li>Start migrating to better use of the maven resource plugins,
    module structure, and updated maven-soa-plugin. </li>
